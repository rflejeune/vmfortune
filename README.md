Fortune script for VM/MVS written in Rexx

This is a very simple Rexx script to display a fortune similar to the mod-fortune program found on most Linux systems.  The 
script was written in Rexx so that it could be easily run withouyt modification on IBM VM and MVS (z/OS) systems to mimic the 
behavior of the fortune program on Linux. 

The script was left intentionally as basic as possible so that it would be easy to modify and to add your favorite fortunes to 
the existing template. 

Enjoy!
